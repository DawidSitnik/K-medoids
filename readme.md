## Implementation K-medoids algorithm with selection of the second best point as an medoids 

### Task Description
The aim of this project is to implement k-medoids clustering algorithm and test it on real data. The algorithm should be able to operate on every amount of attributes and its final output should be similar to the output of sklearn implementation. 

#### Agenda
1. Algorithm description
2. Testing on mocked data
3. Testing time complexity
4. Testing on real data
5. Summary
